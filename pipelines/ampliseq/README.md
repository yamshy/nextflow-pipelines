# nf-core/ampliseq toy run

This configuration targets the nf-core/ampliseq pipeline using the upstream `test` dataset. The bundled `params/toy.json` illustrates the minimum Control API input needed to launch a check-up run.

Expect the workflow to finish in a few minutes with test-sized outputs in your selected `--outdir`.

> Requires Nextflow `23.10.2` (newer releases drop the Groovy helper used in the config include).
